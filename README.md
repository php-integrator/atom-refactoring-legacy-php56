## Legacy
This is a legacy version that requires PHP >= 5.6. Users that are on PHP 7.1 can and should use [the newer version](https://github.com/php-integrator/atom-base).

This package only exists to cater towards users that are not in any position to upgrade their host PHP version. As a result, any issues that appear in this package will not be fixed, no new features will be added and no enhancements will be done.

## About
This package provides refactoring capabilities for your PHP source code using [PHP Integrator](https://github.com/php-integrator/atom-base).

**Note that the [php-integrator-base](https://github.com/php-integrator/atom-base-legacy-php56) package is required and needs to be set up correctly for this package to function correctly.**

**Note that the [intentions](https://github.com/steelbrain/intentions) package is also required. Intentions trigger using the `alt-enter` key by default.**

What is included?
  * Method extraction.
  * Method overriding.
  * Constructor generation.
  * Getter and setter generation.
  * Unimplemented abstract method generation.
  * Unimplemented interface method generation.
  * Docblock generation (press `alt-enter` whilst on a functionlike, classlike or constant).
